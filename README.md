The primary aim of the Student Time Planner is to give students an online web application which will be responsive on mobile too to organize and manage their time for the studies to get good marks and grades along with their own task to do.
The product is a web application where the users can access the application anywhere and anytime. The product is made responsive so the users can use any device with browser application to open it. 
In this project, we used Rational Unified Process as our methodology to complete the development. The RUP allowed developer to do things in iteration, which will be described in later sections.
